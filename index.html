							<p>
								Based in Los Angeles with a focus on the front-end, I’ve coded web products, marketing websites, full site rebrands, e-commerce with Shopify and also currently making low-code digital products with Webflow and Framer that I’m very excited about.
								<br>
								Betterer is my alter ego, my professional mantra, my lack of gooder spelling skillz. When you hire me to develop your website’s front-end, it will be better-er.
